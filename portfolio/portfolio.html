            <h2>Height Measurement Unit</h2>

            <p> In the winter of 2018, N12 Technologies began earnest development of a wide-format 
			version of their product, NanoStich. However, after transitioning to a large-format 
			substrate, their exisitng quality control systems could no longer analyze the product 
			without extensive sample preparation. As the on-site engineer, I was asked to produce an 
			offline quality control tool capable of measuring the thickness of the product layer on 
			the substrate to within &plusmn;5&mu;m. The substrate is a thin foil, and therefore easily flexes.</p>
			
			<p> After researching possible technologies, I decided that a rastering laser certain would be 
			an affordable and effective solution. I sourced a linear stage and laser micrometer with acceptable 
			specifications, and began designing a method to fixture the sample. 
			Because the substrate is coated entirely on one surface, and due to process contaminants 
			on the opposite face, measuring the sample non-destructively was not an option. My goal then  
			became reducing measurement time and required operator training as much as possible, without 
			sacrificing measurement resolution. The final design (Figure 1) is capable of measuring any sample up to 
			24 inches in width, and calculates height data to within &plusmn;4&mu;m (validated against SEM date). 
			With slower scans, it was able to consistently calculate data to within &plusmn;1.5&mu;m, though I 
			opted to reduce read time over the additional increase in resolution.</p>
			
			<img class="pic"  src="../images/OCWHM/height-overview.jpg"/>
			<p class="fig">Figure 1: Rendered isometric view of height measurement unit.<p>
			
			<p> I opted for a 3-point "tent" fixture, which limits operator setup time while also providing 
			a strong reference surface for the laser micrometer to read. The operator is able to slide 
			a sample in with almost no alignment, actuate the clamp bars down, then the reference bar up. The result 
			(cutaway shown in Figure 2) is a peak in the substrate that generates high contrast for the laser. After rastering the laser once, 
			the operator removes the surface coating and repeats the scan. The processing software (written by my colleague) 
			processes the data delta and generates a height profile.</p>

			<p class="fig">Figure 2: Cutaway showing 3-point "tent" fixture. Clamp bars circled in green, reference bar circled in blue, and resulting substrate path highlighted in purple.<p>
			
			<p> One note about the design: something this size could have easily been made from a welded frame. However, 
			given time constraints and quoted leadtimes from metalworking shops, I elected to make the design 
			out of flat plates connected by fasteners. I was able to design many of the plates to require only 
			one fixture operations, significantly reducing the fabrication leadtime.</p>

            <h2>Oil Platform Blowout Preventer Failure</h2>

            <p><span>Due to the confidential nature of this project, certain details have been omitted.</span></p>
			
			<p>In the spring of 2011, an oil well began flowing at the surface, what is referred to 
			as a blowout. All oil rigs are equipped with failsafe hydraulic shutoff values, known as 
			a blowout preventer (BOP). However, when the rig BOPs were activated, the well continued 
			to flow at the surface, causing the rig and well to be lost in an explosion (Figure 1). 
			The resulting damages were claimed for over $5M in losses.</p>
			
			<img class="pic"  src="../images/bop/bop_failure.jpg"/>
			<p class="fig">Figure 1: Photographs of the extracted failed safety components.<p>
			
			<p>During the evidence tear-down and document review process, my group determined that 
			certain critical components were not OEM parts, but rather less expensive third-party 
			components. After many years of discussion between the insurance, operating, and well 
			owning companies, there was no consensus as to whether the BOP failure was due to manufacturing 
			differences between these components, known as packers, or if it was operator error. My team 
			was again retained for an analytical comparative study of the OEM and third-party packers.</p>
			
			<img class="pic"  src="../images/bop/bop_packers.jpg"/>
			<p class="fig">Figure 2: CAD model of dissimilar packer plate geometries in Abaqus CAE.<p>
			
			<p>During this process, my role was inspecting, dimensioning, and modeling the two packer 
			geometries, as well as simulating the BOP activation process with each to determine if the 
			geometric differences had a significant impact in the sealing progressing of the well. The 
			models were a combination of 3D hyperelastic elastomer elements, non-deformable skeletal support 
			geometry, and analytical-rigid surfaces (Figure 2). The results of my simulations showed that 
			the sealing pattern was significantly different and, when compared with the erosion patterns
			within the subject BOP, were the most likely cause of the well failure. The differences in 
			sealing patterns are shown in Video 1, which has been censored for confidentiality. The video 
			will play the sealing sequence twice, the first to show the progression, the second to emphasize 
			the comparison with the physical evidence extracted from the well.</p>

			<p>While this case did go to trial, a settlement was made before the evidence went to deliberation. 
			This outcome was attributed primarily to the analytical analysis performed by myself and my team.</p>

            <h2>Brass Fittings in Potable Water Systems</h2>

            <p><span>Due to the confidential nature of this project, certain details have been omitted.</span></p>
			
			<p>Over the course of several years, various consumer complaints were made that a particular 
			brand of brass fitting was resulting in property damage due to premature corrosion and subsequent 
			plumbing leakage. Due to the scale of potential damages, a class action lawsuit was filed against
			the manufacturer. My team was retained to evaluate these fittings and determine the underlying 
			cause of any premature failure.</p>

			<p class="fig">Figure 1: Example of extracted evidence, which includes fittings and tubing.<p>			
						
			<p>My role in this investigation was primarily focused around extracted evidence (an example shown in Figure 1). 
			I photographed, categorized, and inventoried thousands of samples, developed test protocols, 
			and conducted inter-party inspections over the course of a year. The tests varied in complexity, ranging from 
			a simple microscopy to accelerated environmental exposure.</p>

			<p class="fig">Figure 2: Exemplary sample that had been sectioned, mounted, polished, and imaged under a microscope to study the
			corrosion of the brass.<p>	
			
			<p>Most notable was a three-day leak-testing inspection involving three separate parties, in 
			which approximately 200 extracted samples were photographed and leak tested at our facilities. 
			I oversaw the testing and sample organization, as well 
			maintaining notes and records of the 10 lawyers and experts present as witnesses of the inspection. 
			In addition to leak testing, I also developed and conducted the test protocol for additional sample 
			tear-down, mounting, polishing, and microscopic metallurgical examination (shown in Figure 2).</p>

            <h2>Electrical Transmission Arm Failures</h2>

            <p><span>Due to the confidential nature of this project, certain details have been omitted.</span></p>
			
			<p>In the fall of 2013, multiple high-power electrical transmission tower arms began showing
			signs of cracking at the weld between the arm and mounting bracket (Figure 1). In some cases,
			the arm completely fractured from the bracket, leading to hundreds of miles of transmission arms 
			being taken out of service for inspection. Our client retained my group for a comprehensive 
			analysis of the failure, based on wind and arm strain data collected before the arms were removed
			from service. My role was to review the provided manufacturing and installation documentation, 
			inspect the subject arm brackets, and develop a versatile finite element model to explore our failure
			mode hypotheses.</p>
			
			<img class="pic"  src="../images/transmission/transmission_failure.jpg"/>
			<p class="fig">Figure 1: Example of failed bracket arm, showing arm separated from bracket at the weld.<p>
			
			<p>Based on the manufacturing design specifications, I modelled the arm and bracket in SolidWorks
			and imported the geometry to Abaqus CAE. After meshing and boundary conditions, I used the strain
			data from the previous wind studies to validate my model. My initial results, using a simple static
			model, suggested that service loads alone could not have caused the premature weld fractures. After 
			a physical examination of multiple subject failed arms, I determined that the spacing between the 
			mounting plates of the bracket was regularly over-tolerance. In addition, I reviewed the field installation
			notes, which showed inconsistent bolt tightening sequences and torques. To estimate the effects of these 
			pre-service defects, I expanded the static model to include full-contact bolting of the arm to the pole, 
			which I manipulated to consider various arm manufacturing and installation scenarios.</p>
			
			<img class="pic"  src="../images/transmission/transmission_contours.jpg"/>
			<p class="fig">Figure 2: Estimated stress contours resulting from bracket design and installation errors.<p>
			
			<p>My results, shown in Figure 2, demonstrated that with a gap at the maximum design tolerance, smaller 
			than the gap recorded during the inspection, and a correct bolt tightening sequence and torque, the stress 
			in the weld would surpass yield in static conditions. Accounting for the additional effects of cycling 
			dynamic wind loads, I demonstrated that the arm design tolerances would cause the welds to fail by yield 
			and fatigue well before their expected service life. Based on my findings and our full report, our 
			client was able to begin taking corrective action and consider liabilities.</p>

            <h2>Record Player Restoration</h2>
			
			<p>After finding my partner's grandparent's turntable, I was inspired to restore it to it's original working 
			condition. After looking it over, I found it was a 1956 Admiral Classic FN2 turntable. Original 
			High Fidelity. Up until then, I had assumed I would gut the internal electronics and replace them with the 
			functional components of a more modern turntable. However, the internals were overall in superb condition. 
			After seeing this, I decided to keep everything as original as possible. I ordered some spare needles 
			and tubes from eBay and began looking into the state of the electronics.</p>
			
			<img class="pic"  src="../images/record/record_internals.jpg"/>
			<p class="fig">Figure 1: Record amp internals. All original capacitors were cardboard with wax.<p>			
						
			<p>I had hoped to reference the component sizes and ratings from the casings, but underestimated the quality
			of 60-year-old electronics. I thankfully found a circuit schematic to reference on a radio museum website. I 
			considered designing a PCB to simply replace the birds-nest wiring (shown in Figure 1), but I wanted to 
			preserve the antique sound. After researching radio refurbishment, I decided to replace all of the capacitors,
			a select number of resistors, and the power cord. I also elected to instll a 5A inline fuse.</p>
			
			<img class="pic"  src="../images/record/record_finished.jpg"/>
			<p class="fig">Figure 2: After replacing all capacitors and select resistors.<p>	
			
			<p>While the record player is now functional (and filling my evenings with Steely Dan), there are a few more
			components I would like to repair to improve quality. The motor speed is irregular and slightly fast, but  could 
			easily be fixed by a modern DC motor and variable PSU. Additionally, the motor-to-table drive mechanism is a 
			thin belt, which has began to harden and elongate. This could likely be replaced with an off-the-shelf component.</p>
